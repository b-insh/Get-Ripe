# Get Ripe!

## MVP

With GetRipe! users will be able to use a variety of tools to make a fruit visibly ripen on a tree.

- [ ] Choose between a watering can, sunlight, and fertilizer to ripen the fruit with corresponding rule sets
- [ ] Fruit on the tree changes according to what tool is used on it
- [ ] Alert when fruit is ripe
- [ ] Restart the simulation from the beginning

## Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented using the following technologies:

* Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.
* Three.js for rendering and manipulation of the objects
* Vanilla javascript for fruit ripening logic

## Implementation Timeline

**Day 1:** Set up project and all necessary node modules, install all necessary libraries and learn the basics of Three.js. Watch demos of other people's projects to understand how it works.

Goals:
- [ ] Learn enough Three.js to render first objects to the screen

**Day 2:** Continue learning Three.js and understand its API, implement game logic and create rule sets for the different tools.

Goals:
- [ ] Build out game logic for when a fruit is fully ripe, counting the ripe fruit, etc
- [ ] Have different objects affect the fruit's rendering in different ways

**Day 3:** Install controls for user to interact with the app, including restart and ability to see how many fruits they have. Clean up remaining rendering issues and add more to background etc if time.

Goals:
- [ ] Create user controls
- [ ] Polish project
