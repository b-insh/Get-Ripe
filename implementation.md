# Get Ripe!

## MVP

With GetRipe! users will be able to water a tree and grow a delicious fruit.

- [ ] Shower a tree with water from a watering can or shine sunlight
- [ ] Fruit on the tree changes according to what tool is used
- [ ] Movable watering can

## Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented using the following technologies:

* Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.
* Three.js for rendering and manipulation of the objects
* Tween.js to manage fruit's size change animations
* Vanilla javascript for game logic

## Implementation Timeline

**Day 1:** Set up project and all necessary node modules, install all necessary libraries and learn the basics of Three.js. Watch demos of other people's projects to understand how it works.

Goals:
- [ ] Learn enough Three.js to render first objects to the screen

**Day 2:** Research and implement drag and drop in 3D space

Goals:
- [ ] Have watering can be able to be dragged and dropped
- [ ] If the can is pouring, have the water stream move with it

**Day 3:** Continue learning Three.js and understand its API, implement game logic and create rule sets for the different tools.

Goals:
- [ ] Have different objects affect the fruit's rendering in different ways
